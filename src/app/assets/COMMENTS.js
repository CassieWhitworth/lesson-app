Cassie has helped me enjoy playing the trumpet again with no judgement and endless encouragement. I urge any other adult who is afraid it's too late to learn or re-learn music to just GO FOR IT!"

On a scale of 1 to 5 - 1 being she'd rather eat a plate of broccoli and 5 being becoming a unicorn - piano lessons are a solid 4.5. I ususally don't have nice things to say about teachers or retail workers or servers or...you get the picture, but Cassie gets 5 stars in my book!"
